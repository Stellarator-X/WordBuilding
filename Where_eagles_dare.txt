The vibrating clangour from the four great piston engines set teeth on edge and made an intolerable assault on cringing eardrums. The decibel-level, Smith calculated, must have been about that found in a
boiler factory, and one, moreover, that was working on overtime rates, while the shaking cold in that cramped, instrument-crowded flight-deck was positively Siberian. On balance, he reflected, he would
have gone for the Siberian boiler factory any time because, whatever its drawbacks, it wasn't liable to fall out of the sky or crash into a mountain-side which, in his present circumstances, seemed a likely
enough, if not imminent contingency for all that the pilot of their Lancaster bomber appeared to care to the contrary. Smith looked away from the darkly opaque world beyond the windscreens where the
wipers fought a useless battle with the driving snow and looked again at the man in the left-hand captain's seat.
Wing Commander Cecil Carpenter was as completely at home in his environment as the most contented
oyster in his shell inWhitstableBay . Any comparison with a Siberian boiler factory he would have
regarded as the ravings of an unhinged mind. Quite dearly, he found the shuddering vibration as soothing
as the ministrations of the gentlest of masseurs, the roar of the-engines positively soporific and the
ambient temperature just right for a man of his leisured literary tastes. Before him, at a comfortable
reading distance, a book rested on a hinged contraption which he had swung out from the cabin's side.
From what little Smith could occasionally see of the lurid cover, depicting a blood-stained knife plunged
into the back of a girl who didn't seem to have any clothes on, the Wing Commander held the more
serious contemporary novelists in a fine contempt. He turned a page.
