'A hive of activity and no mistake,' Schaffer observed. 'I wonder -- ' He broke off, his eyes widening. A
giant tank came rumbling into view past the guard-house, turned right on to the road, stopped, swivelled
about on its tracks, completely blocking the road: the gun turret moved fractionally until it was lined up on
the headlights of the approaching bus. ,'Oh, my gosh!' Schaffer's shocked whisper was just audible over
the fading sound of the post-bus's diesel. 'A Tiger tank. And that's an 88-millimetre cannon, boss.'
'It's not a pop-gun, and that's a fact,' Smith agreed. 'Flat on the -floor.' He reached forward, pulled a
switch, and the eighteen-inch long semaphore indicator began to wave gently up and down. Smith first
dipped his main headlights, then switched them off altogether, covering the last thirty yards on side-lamps
alone and praying that all those signs of peaceful normality might help to keep nervous fingers away from
the firing button of the most lethal tank cannon ever devised.
