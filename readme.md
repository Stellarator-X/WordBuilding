# Word Building 

Rules of the game:
  1. Build words letter by letter. The objective is to manipulate moves such that the last alphabet is entered by the opponent or one of the opponents
  2. If at any point in time a sequence has been created which does not form a prefix to any word in our vocabulary, then the current player asks the previous player to disclose the word they're trying to form.</br>
  3. If the answer is a valid word as per the rules, the current player loses a point and vice versa.

### Commands:

#### exit()
